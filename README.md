Introduction:  According to Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation, cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, taking a toll of eighteen million lives each year, and accounts for thirty-one percent of all deaths worldwide. In a simple sense, four out of five deaths in cardiovascular diseases are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under seventy years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by cardiovascular diseases and this dataset contains twelve features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease:
  1. Age: age of the patient [years]
  2. Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
  3. ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
  4. RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
  5. Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
  6. FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
  7. RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
  8. MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
  9. ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
  10. Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
  11. ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
  12. HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk is due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease. Therefore, machine learning can be a great asset to the early detection and mangement of people who have cardiovascular disease or who simply have high cardiovascular risk.
